# productivity-app

This is a productivity app called 'Productivia App' (No copyright infringement intended, just needed a decent name) made using the MERN stack. This is my first fullstack application and is just the beginning of my Front-End journey. There's so much more in store for this app in the near future which includes; Login Authentification, Mobile App using React Native, and more!

Stack:
  - FRONT-END
    • HTML
    • Sass
    • React.js Functional Components
  - BACK-END
    • Node.js
    • Express.js
    • MongoDB Atlas

Building this initial iteration has taught me so much more of React FC than I definitely thought I already knew. This also was an amazing opportunity to build multiple "small beginner" projects into one decently sized application. Gave me a chance to learn a little of what the Back-End and a Database can do and how it is used. This project has shown me that I know more than what I thought, but also that amount of room to grow is infinitely larger than what was anticipated.

Breaking down the project into section:
- Home
  • This was the last and final part of the app.
  • Building was rather simple, especially once I figured to use props in the top level function of the component. This made using functions and variables     from the App.jsx file a LOT smoother and much less of a headache.
